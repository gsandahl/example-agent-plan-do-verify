# Sample AI Agent Framework

This repository contains a simple AI agent framework built with [Opper](https://opper.ai) that demonstrates how to create intelligent agents with reasoning capabilities.

## What's Included

### BaseAgent (`base_agent.py`)

A foundational class for building AI agents that use a **Think ‚Üí Act** reasoning loop. The BaseAgent provides:

**Core Reasoning Loop:**
- **Think**: Analyzes current situation, reviews previous results, and decides next action
- **Act**: Executes actions using available tools 
- **Repeat**: Continues until goal is achieved or max iterations reached

**Key Features:**
- **Iteration Awareness**: Tracks progress and plans efficiently within iteration limits
- **Tool Management**: Dynamic tool registration and execution with parameter validation
- **Context Management**: Maintains execution context across iterations for data sharing
- **Smart Planning**: AI-driven action selection that prioritizes tool usage over direct responses
- **Structured I/O**: Pydantic schemas for consistent input/output formatting
- **Comprehensive Tracing**: Built-in observability with Opper for debugging and monitoring
- **Flexible Architecture**: Use directly with tools/description or extend via subclassing
- **Real-time Callbacks**: Status updates for UI integration and progress monitoring
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure recovery with detailed error reporting

### MathAgent (`math_agent.py`)

A complete example showing how to use BaseAgent to create a math-solving agent. It includes:

- **Custom Tools**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- **Structured Output**: Returns detailed solutions with reasoning steps
- **Goal Processing**: Solves complex math problems step-by-step
- **Status Callbacks**: Real-time updates during problem solving

Example run output:

```
Agent: MathAgent
Goal: Calculate the result of (25 * 4) + (100 / 5) - 7
Available tools: add, subtract, multiply, divide
I will now compute the first term by multiplying 25 by 4.
I will now divide 100 by 5 to calculate the second term.
I will proceed to add the results of the first term (100) and the second term (20) together.
I am about to subtract 7 from 120 to complete the calculation.
Result: 113
```

### EmailAgent (`email_agent.py`)

A comprehensive Gmail-integrated agent that automates email management workflows. It includes:

- **Gmail API Integration**: Secure OAuth authentication with Gmail
- **Smart Email Listing**: Flexible email filtering with query support (unread, specific senders, etc.)
- **Intelligent Email Analysis**: AI-powered categorization, priority assessment, and sentiment analysis
- **Label Management**: Automatic label creation and application for email organization
- **Reply Assessment**: Determines if emails need responses and urgency levels
- **Draft Generation**: Creates contextual draft replies with proper threading
- **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple emails efficiently with iteration management
- **Comprehensive Workflow**: From email discovery to categorization, labeling, and response drafting

Example run output:

```
Agent: EmailAgent
Goal: Go through the last 10 undread emails, apply labels (info, spam, news, personal) and draft responses in cases where appropriate (such as obvious follow up questions)
Available tools: gmail_auth, list_emails, read_email, fetch_unreplied_emails, add_draft_response, add_email_tag
Fetching the 10 most recent unread emails so we can review, label, and draft any needed replies.

Applying the 'personal' label to the first email (Lunch invitation) as identified.
Creating a draft reply for the lunch invitation email so you can review and send it. After this, I will continue analyzing and labeling the remaining unread emails.
Fetching the remaining unread emails to continue processing.
```

## Quick Start

### Math Agent

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install opperai pydantic
```

2. **Set your Opper API key**:
```bash
export OPPER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

3. **Run the math agent example**:
```bash
python math_agent.py
```

### Email Agent

1. **Install all dependencies**:
```bash
python setup_email_agent.py
```

2. **Set up Gmail API credentials**:
   - Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Create a new project or select existing one
   - Enable the Gmail API
   - Configure OAuth consent screen
   - Create OAuth 2.0 credentials (Desktop application)
   - Download credentials as `credentials.json`

3. **Set your Opper API key**:
```bash
export OPPER_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

4. **Run the email agent**:
```bash
python email_agent.py
```

The first run will open a browser window for Gmail authentication. After authorization, the agent can:
- List and filter emails (unread, specific senders, date ranges, etc.)
- Analyze emails for category, priority, sentiment, and action items
- Apply appropriate labels for organization (work, personal, urgent, etc.)
- Determine reply necessity and urgency
- Generate contextual draft responses with proper threading

## Creating Your Own Agent

### Basic Example

```python
from base_agent import BaseAgent, Tool

# Define your tools
class MyTool(Tool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="my_tool",
            description="What this tool does",
            parameters={"param": "str - Description of parameter"}
        )
    
    def execute(self, _parent_span_id=None, param: str = "", **kwargs) -> dict:
        return {
            "success": True,
            "result": f"Processed: {param}",
            "data": {"input": param}
        }

# Create your agent
agent = BaseAgent(
    name="MyAgent",
    description="What your agent does",
    tools=[MyTool()],
    max_iterations=25,
    verbose=True
)

# Use your agent
result = agent.process("Your goal here")
```

### Configuration Options

The BaseAgent constructor accepts these parameters:

- **`name`**: Agent identifier for tracing and logging
- **`opper_api_key`**: Optional API key (uses OPPER_API_KEY env var if not provided)  
- **`max_iterations`**: Maximum reasoning loop iterations (default: 25)
- **`verbose`**: Enable detailed execution logging (default: False)
- **`output_schema`**: Pydantic model for structured result formatting
- **`tools`**: List of Tool instances for the agent to use
- **`description`**: Agent description for AI context
- **`callback`**: Function to receive status updates (`callback(event_type, data)`)

### Tool Development

Tools should:
- Inherit from the `Tool` base class
- Accept `_parent_span_id` for tracing AI calls within tools
- Return structured results with success indicators
- Handle errors gracefully
- Use `**kwargs` for parameter flexibility

## How It Works

The BaseAgent implements a sophisticated **Think ‚Üí Act** reasoning loop:

### Core Process

1. **Initialize**: Agent receives a goal and sets up tracing/context
2. **Think**: AI analyzes the situation and decides on the next action
   - Reviews previous action results
   - Considers available tools and parameters
   - Tracks iteration count and remaining iterations
   - Updates execution context with important data
   - Decides if goal is achieved or what action to take next
3. **Act**: Agent executes the chosen action using appropriate tools
4. **Repeat**: Process continues until goal achieved or max iterations reached

### Example Flow

```
üéØ Goal: "Calculate (25 * 4) + (100 / 5) - 7"
üîÑ Max iterations: 25

--- Iteration 1 ---
üß† Think: Need to solve math expression, will multiply 25 * 4 first
‚ö° Act: multiply_tool(a=25, b=4) ‚Üí 100

--- Iteration 2 ---  
üß† Think: Got 100, now need to divide 100 / 5
‚ö° Act: divide_tool(a=100, b=5) ‚Üí 20

--- Iteration 3 ---
üß† Think: Have 100 and 20, need to add them
‚ö° Act: add_tool(a=100, b=20) ‚Üí 120

--- Iteration 4 ---
üß† Think: Have 120, need to subtract 7 to complete
‚ö° Act: subtract_tool(a=120, b=7) ‚Üí 113

--- Iteration 5 ---
üß† Think: All calculations complete, goal achieved
‚úÖ Result: 113
```

### Advanced Features

- **Iteration Management**: Agent tracks progress and adjusts strategy based on remaining iterations
- **Context Sharing**: Important data persists across iterations for complex workflows
- **Tool Prioritization**: Agent prefers using tools over direct responses when possible
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of tool failures with alternative approaches
- **Structured Output**: Consistent result formatting with detailed execution history

The framework abstracts all complexity of LLM interactions, tool orchestration, and reasoning loops while providing full observability and control.
